# CanSplitSequence
Given S - a sequence of n integers S = s1, s2, ..., sn. To find if it is  possible to split S into two parts: s1, s2, ..., si and si+1, si+2, ..., sn (1 &lt;= i &lt; n) in  such a way that the first part is strictly decreasing while the second is strictly  increasing one.

Strictly increasing means that equal values are not treated as 
increasing or decreasing. See example 3 below. Input data specificaƟon: - There 
will be two inputs to the funcƟon. - First input will be the number of elements in 
the sequence. - Second input will be the array of elements Output data 
specificaƟon: - One word: Yes or No. 
 Example 1: - Input: 5, -1 2 -1 1 -1 - Output: 
No Example 2: - Input: 6, 3 1 -2 -2 -1 3 - Output: Yes 
Example 3: - Input: 6, 2 2 1 0 1 2 - Output: No
